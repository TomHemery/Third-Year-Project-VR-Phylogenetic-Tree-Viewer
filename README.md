# Third Year Project - VR Visualisation of Phylogenetic Data

This repo contains the result of my third year dissertation project, looking at visualizing phylogenetic data in VR using Unity and the HTC Vive Focus (a mobile, android based VR headset)

## Getting Started

To run the project please checkout the main branch, then build it via the unity editor.

### Prerequisites


Unity: 2019.2.5f1 or later.

The Vive Wave API -> SDK for Unity

Optional: a Vive Focus headset, for the optimal experience this should be run on the headset, the PC controls are for debug only and are anything but intuitive. You are forewarned.
